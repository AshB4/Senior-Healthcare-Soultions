Containers

Purpose:
Containers are components that primarily handle the business logic and state management of your application. They often connect to a global state (like Redux or Context API) or manage their own local state. Containers are responsible for fetching data, handling user interactions, and passing data down to presentational components.
Role:
Containers typically do not handle much UI rendering themselves. Instead, they act as intermediaries between the state and the presentational (or "dumb") components that are responsible for displaying the UI. They manage the flow of data and determine how the application behaves based on user input or API responses.
Examples:
A UserProfileContainer might fetch user data from an API, manage that data in the state, and pass it down to a UserProfile component that handles the actual rendering of the UI.
A PostsContainer could manage a list of posts, handle pagination, and pass the relevant data to a PostsList component.
Location:
Containers are often placed in a /containers directory. This keeps them organized and separate from the more UI-focused components.

Summary of Containers:
Focus on managing state, logic, and data fetching.
Typically do not render much UI directly.
Serve as intermediaries between state and presentational components.
Located in a /containers directory.

In summary, containers manage the "how" of your application (data, state, and logic).
