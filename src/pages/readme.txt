Pages

Purpose:
Pages are components that represent specific routes in your application. They are often directly tied to the routing system (like React Router) and define the structure and content for a particular URL or view within the application.
Role:
Pages generally compose multiple components (including containers and presentational components) to build out a full view. They act as the blueprint for the different sections of your application, such as the homepage, user profile page, or dashboard.
Examples:
A HomePage might assemble components like a Header, FeaturedArticlesContainer, Footer, and Sidebar to create the full layout for the homepage.
A DashboardPage could include a DashboardHeader, DashboardStatsContainer, RecentActivity, and Footer.
Location:
Pages are typically placed in a /pages directory. This makes it clear that they correspond to the main routes or views of your app.

Summary:
Represent specific routes or views in your application.
Assemble multiple components, including containers, to form a complete UI layout.
Directly tied to the routing system (e.g., React Router).
Located in a /pages directory.

/pages manage the "what" (the overall structure and layout of the views).
